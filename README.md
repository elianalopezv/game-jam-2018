# Rex Infection :syringe: Puzzle AR Game.

This is an atypical mobile game. It is a game that you must control using a cube in your hand! What?? Yes.

It works reading the markers of a physical cube with your phone camera and translating the images to movements. Pretty cool.

And also, it was made in only THREE DAYS! :fearful: For the anual Game Jam contest.

You can check it out all about this game :point_right: [HERE][1] :point_left:
